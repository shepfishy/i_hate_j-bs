# So, do you hate J*bs? Well I have a solution!

This is a browser extension I made, it censors Job related words like: 'career', 'application', and ofcourse, 'J*b'.
**Req: chrome w/ developer mode enabled in the chrome [extensions](chrome://extensions) menu**

Click 'load unpacked' and select the 'src' folder to load the extension.
